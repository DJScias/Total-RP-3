### Fixed

- Improved the workaround for the text cursor misalignment issue brought by patch 7.3 in the EditBox. The text no longer go beyond the limits of the EditBox.

## [1.2.9.2] - 2017-09-14

### Fixed

- Implemented a temporary workaround for the issue introduced by patch 7.3 in the game's code that cause the misalignment of the text cursor in multi lines text fields. Note that this workaround is not perfect, and result in empty lines visible at the bottom of the text, but at least the cursor is actually on the right line. But Blizzard is aware of the issue and is working on fixing it properly on their end.
